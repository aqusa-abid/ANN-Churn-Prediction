Customer Churn Prediction using ANN
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will stay with a company or leave (churn) using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
The model is trained on a churn dataset and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

The system helps businesses identify potential churn customers in advance so that retention strategies can be applied.

🧠 Project Structure

The project consists of three main parts:

1. Model Training

Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, feature selection)

Building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Training the model on historical customer churn data

Saving the trained model for later use

2. Model Prediction

Loading the trained ANN model

Accepting new customer data as input

Predicting whether the customer will Stay or Churn

3. Web App & Deployment (Streamlit)

User-friendly interface built using Streamlit

Input fields for customer features

Real-time prediction display

Ready for deployment as a web application

⚙️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning:

TensorFlow / Keras (ANN Model)

Scikit-learn (Preprocessing, Scaling, Encoding)

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA)

Web Framework: Streamlit

Deployment: Streamlit Cloud / Local Server

🚀 How to Run

Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Streamlit app

streamlit run app.py


Enter customer details and get churn prediction.

📊 Output

The model predicts:

0 → Customer will stay

1 → Customer will churn
